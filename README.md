```
file-based html and XML?

have my javascript fatigue so it's kind of boring.
too lazy to work with cloud so I make it as file-based like dafuq.

seriously I do portfolio with framework for what? design? recognition? life-easier to debug?

I don't understand how I get there for what I did even it's a skill issue but thanks.
