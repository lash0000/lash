            So yeah, are you typically starting your experience to learn coding
            together with your choice that you might been consider in your
            future?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            If that so, is it there's someone encourage you before to learn a
            specific programming language that he/she prefer for you to begin
            and understand some opportunities that they offer for you to follow
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Or, you're actually learning that specific programming language thru
            forcibly I hope you're not experiencing this because its terrilbly
            looks bad.

            I'm curious for how does the youtube became the primary source to
            learn coding where in fact it is better to read than just watching
            demonstration this is common but it's still can't practice as the
            way that experience developers expect for new developers.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Wait, how do you learn programming? we're just watching YouTube and
            just copy paste the code until it will work right? have you learn
            about it? sometimes yes but if I try to understand how does it
            happen well it's hard to know.

            Here in this tweet as you can see this is drastically telling their
            hate to proceed with their choice I've experience this I ask some
            guys in discord that do you think learning JavaScript is good but in
            a way that I wanted to look some good-point response it turns out to
            be more disbelief which I totally disagree I have some article here
            (entitled My only reason to code) that I frequently said that
            JavaScript is for n00bs but the truth it wasn't met to be there as
            the way that I tell what it is that was a joke in that time so I'm
            sorry.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Anyways, if there's someone who disagrees for the things that you
            really wanted to learn you can just simply ignore it because they
            can't help you in the beginning upto long-run this is common but a
            crucial one so sometimes the way we pick to learn can be disaster or
            it brings more cherish because either they don't like that or they
            don't want too.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So for this article I just want to sound like positively because
            this is actually pretty insult to those people who wanted to learn
            coding so let me tell you some story about it
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            In history of JavaScript, when the ES6 (ECMAScript Version 6) was
            released to the public by the recommendation of W3C to meet their
            ethical standards for the developers in many reason this was the way
            that the reason that I see why React, Angular and Vue JavaScript
            frameworks exist to become a king to handle the future of web
            development.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            When the ES6 was released, it was a game-changing for the web
            developers this is the reason why some of the wizard web
            developers with a experience of more than 5 years is actually
            disagree with these kind of future.

          <figcaption>
            Last month, I watch this conference that tells their improvement for
            their software which you can see after they remove the React
            libraries then they decide to switch with the single library named
            HTMX basically this is a simple library for communicating with AJAX
            into your backend as well so what's the biggest reason why they
            don't want to follow with these kind of future?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            First of all that's not case they had some pretty discussion about
            it where it tells the simple reality of JavaScript which the wizard
            + guru web developers wants to tell it seriously.
          </figcaption>

            <img

          </picture>
          <figcaption>
            So yeah, this is the picture that I referring basically in my
            understanding it's about the things they pragmatic used to. So
            JavaScript before the React, Angular and Vue exist is actually not
            very much to care for I mean they just want to do some stuffs like
            DOM manipulation, simple tasks alerts, do some unobstrusive methods
            and so much more just for doing front-end operation.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So, in that part I was telling what they exactly do during their days
            and then, things we're getting weird as expected they become more
            angry to encourage the future web developers to consider not to
            begin with JavaScript.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So what was the biggest reason they don't want too? It was
            unexplainable to me because their reasonings is like "NodeJS is a
            biggest mistake based on the principal author itself." Like what?
            the issue doesn't connect here like dafuq are they joking? do they
            understand the initial point of the author of NodeJS itself? You
            know even me I can't actually understand why the author of NodeJS
            named Ryan Dahl for telling the reason why inventing his own
            JavaScript runtime was a mistake it sounds like the wizard + guru
            devs are actually pretty laugh about it.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Plus, there is another APIs which they claim it as useless called
            HATEOAS which stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application
            State explore more about it I think start from HTMX website.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So if I ask you the same question, do you think learning JavaScript
            as your first ideal language is good? Yes, it's totally good if you
            feel actually better for it so why not to consider? you're now there
            and live for a good to begin with.

            Making some debates upon Programming Language is one of the most
            stupid things that ever exist aside from they wanted to make the
            developers who use that kind of language to be bad for them also,
            they produce so many disbeliefs about it which I totally it pisses

            I know that having some debates for programming languages to me its
            like a business trip where actually it tells like hey, I want you to
            use this because that different thing doesn't have it while we had
            over it so if you experience it you could probably ignore and mind
            your own stuff that's how things can end simply after all.
