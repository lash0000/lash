            <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
            <p>Before, proceeding I just want to tell in a fact that this article considered as dark for some reason this can probably change your personal beliefs and perspectives that alludes to your mind.</p>
          </div>
          <figcaption>
           I just actually release this article before ending the first months of year 2024, actually I'm not fine as hell like oh my god, I committed again the worst situation that I realize I never learn in my own mistakes especially in my dark past.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I cannot tell my dark past because it was so painful and terrible thing experience that I cannot just erase in my life whether if one day is my final day on earth.         
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Here's the thing, In my 2nd year of 1st semesters here in our univesity since I committed more absences I was doing more and more lies again to my classmates by saying that I was busy in my work where they didn't know that I just wanted to stay in my house. 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            There's a story and perfect reason that I committed more absences compared to my elementary and high school experiences here are my three reason.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            First, I had a lots of pressure to interact with every single of them, I mean it's normal to think that they should have their own life to survive and become alumni in the end.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Second, I really don't like their personalities, this may sound like unconscious in some scenario but when you bother their perspectives it seems like do they even use their brains to understand many many weird things ofcourse not? What about the common narratives that you may heard so overrated like "<b>basta tahimik, goods yan</b> (Translate in English: If he/she quiet means good)" so I really dought in a fact that how much they would have wanted to follow their fucking parents to show that they really work hard at school? 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            You know every pockets we or you might get from your parents should held in your mind that you have a responsibility? Yes, it's true but I cannot guarantee to fulfill my studies because of having a low reading comprehension but the point is how can I succeed to write my own articles in english form am I lying? Probably yes but that's not the whole idea. 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Since I had the low reading comprehension this is actually weird in a fact that I was able to communicate and speak formally in english but in person it was very hard I think this statement may only applies to internet so this is true.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Lastly, I committed more absences because they had lack of providing more and more high ethical standards in education but what the fuck why do I wanted to stick with these kind of looks? Do I have to consider some special about it like almost of the people that I encountered where it does the guys who had the perfect academic record in their past should be better to take the crucial responsibilities like Leadership? and Excellence? are they stupid if their intentions was to leaving them too much pressures to take in.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            To be honest, in every classrooms you cannot just see me if I listen to your discussions and your own words of wisdom I know this is a reason for some of guys like me that I should not get anymore pockets coming from my parents if the intention is to make them bastards and foolish. 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            "Complete your degree that's the best worthy you may ever had." Yeah, I get the point but how you use the word "worthy" is it worthy to live? or you just want to keep saying it for a single purpose cannot you tell?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I really hate my parents in such a thing upon their lazy ideologies like they really never learn about their past especially in their youngest days, It is actually an insult whenever they say the iconic tagline <b>"laki kasi ako sa hirap kaya di ako nakapag-college"</b> (Translate in english: I belong to poverty that's why I didn't proceed to college) like oh my fuck you, how dare you that almost of 30 or 40 years of your life just got wasted to not just fulfill to complete your studies.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            It's better to stop studying for college in a while and just take it not too long. Is it that hard to say no it was not like fucking hell. So in my parents if you read these I hate you all burn your ashes and reflect please upon your regrets (angry atm).
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            To my classmates, I see their capabilities in a fact that they do follow for real in every discussions i'm happy that they're able to deal on it but questioning to my own persona should not inherit in your own path within to success.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            To my university, you had the best institutions compared to those popular schools from Manila but you cannot fool us in a fact that having to belong in such a Big Four is still different to anything I know that my school is local-based so meaningfully all of my professors and all of my classmates just wanted to live in some kinds of hope, harmony and peace? Like is that you all? why not to compete and make a dream to be part of them like raise your high ethical standards and provide the best education that we may committed so far?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            During my entrance exams I was able to tampered those questions from the google form in the internet and yet you just spread the lie on us that you do have the monitoring software like what the fuck? are you trying to invade our compute privacy we had the laws so I hope they must accountable on what they saying lol.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So right now, the fucking ideology that the future Filipino Gen Z and Filipino Gen Alpha should do responsibility to finish their studies right ok fair enough but you cannot just actually get rid of your own personal regrets especially you do not complete your studies. So this statement is for my fucking parents I cannot leave them empty in their own stupidity.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            In my 20s I should be able to find a job inside the company and the position that I wanted and yet this fucking asshole Secretary of Education in the Philippines is really a mess to why not make a common fulfillment to endorse all Public High-Schools as mandatory to consider that being High School Graduate should allowed to take serious job especially under BPO? 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I do acknowledge in a fact that base on the 1987 Philippine Constitution prohibits the foreign own business you may heard about 60% shares for initial owner and 40% shares for filipino trustee right? Before, the Presidential Campaign was reign I used to be a believer for a Charter Change like I really wanted for the Philippines to shift into Parliamentary Type of Government but in terms of Federalism I cannot guarantee to think about the future since when we say Federalism it takes a lot of burden to change anything like cultural, making the cities more control to theirs so the corruption can lead more but expected it doesn't really happen like that. 
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            As a IT Person and not well knowledgeable to politics at the moment I was able to tell how the Parliamentary works except Federalism but for that I can actually leave it in different articles so let me stop here for this kind of discussion.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So yeah, right now I establish my personal twitter account into available commissioner level I would have wanted to engage with UI designs more rather than just coding around I mean for real in my life coding has been my root cause in a fact that I was able to understand everything about internet but it a while I realize I don't have a capability to think about server side things, database and more about backend shit.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            In my life I really wanted to care about User Interface Design I know that this similars to Human Computer Interaction to succeed my User Experience Scenarios I really like it after all.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So kindly check my twitter btw thanks for reading and understanding the things that I get offended.
