            The month of today is March so way back 2021 when we bought our third 
            desktop computer in my life by the way the second one was the AMD so it has
            A4 Chipset with the EMAXX motherboard together but after a months within that year
            I made a mistake that after I manage to change my power supply I just only realize there 
            limits so my chipset came to fire and I manage very quickly to remove everything.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So my chipset actually if I remember I actually tell to my parents that it leaves so burnt
            but I forget that I just manage to throw it away despite I knew that it's still fine same with
            my EMAXX motherboard way back then if I didn't make any careless just like what I do way back
            I believe I can actually use it still for working with Hyprland.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            But suddenly as of January my monitor has already been DEAD especially my laptop monitor so I 
            don't have money yet to fix my mess all over so I don't intend to write many blogs here until 
            If I decided to do it right now.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            By the way just earlier around morning I managed my NVIDIA old model to still useful on mine for
            my everyday task which therefore, I really wanted to apply such an memorable aesthetic desktop 
            before my eyes.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I know that this is really absurd like why am I the only one here in my place was actually
            able to look for something different? Honestly, there's no provocative answer.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I was really fascinated to what I see inside the unixporn channel available in Reddit 
            until I found Hyprland desktop environment available to Arch but suddenly even in these 
            date their support for NVIDIA old models doesn't really guarantee to support with.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            But that's okay even if you're one of the developers there. I don't want to consider 
            it as a big problem I just want to live with my memorable masterpieces that comes to my 
            life and this includes my beautiful desktop.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I am that kind of person who use to live with just computers like I don't have any talent 
            that I should consider whether if I just say for you in just a fact that I had some interests 
            to learn to play Guitar or just learning something to make my own fashion dress for example 
            I want to know how to use Sewing Machine.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Now, I have some stupid question? Do you think an all alone individual who does have secretly
            outstanding talents can survive during his lifetime?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Don't hate me for that like I said my real talent is being engaged to know every scenario that
            involves only computers so for rest is none I think anyone can understand these right? 
            I don't have any talents except just computing that's it.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So let's back to main topic so I really love my current setup right now to be honest
            I do note that BSPWM is available to Debian based I like it but I don't know if these dotfile
            can guarantee too? so maybe if I become lazy now with Arch Distro then I will try my best to
            go back once if it's over.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            For now, I love my setup but still sad for a fact that I should only Nouveau drivers instead of
            installing NVIDIA proprietary versions available in order to get rid of random stutterings and 
            some unexpected weird behaviors that I occur way back to Debian times.

            As you can see in my first part, I am currently using X11 over Wayland that's okay so my initial setup 
            right now I guess should be Windows for Gaming and GNU/Linux for my simple work I cannot my GNU/Linux setup too.
            just because for a fact that my screen sharing is so much laggy so I just want to only use it for simple task 
            and that's it for these article I hope you learn something.
