            Dark Side of Open Source (such a reaction)

            Before we get to proceed in my whole reaction of exploring the
            opposite behind contributing FOSS world (which stands for Free and
            Open Source Software) Let's take some mini-brief in the part why
            does it exist and how does that kind could shape the monopoly of
            many closed-source software which we can see in the popular shit
            applications as we know.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            The idea of FOSS doesn't met for money yes I get it despite in the
            following days we may have already shit tons of different things
            that we work for.

            The common idea is either the developer does have some times to work
            for his own ideal thing (software or whatever) as a learning path
            despite it's met for nothing or the developer is just working to
            help only community.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            You know if I can ask some question why does the majority of popular
            applications we know is frequently closed-source based simply
            because they disagree in some idea to make almost of the operations
            they work could lead some INFOLEAKS until it can be manipulate
            easily. Sometimes it can be but the whole scenario doesn't really
            met to be there whereas, it is better to learn those things behind
            rather than just keeping it secretly so it's really hard to tell for
            mandating our privacy concerns that's what I taught.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Some Tech-giant chunkies could not practically acknowledge the
            open-source libraries by providing simply what they used this should
            be not a big deal right? Just like how Discord manage they did?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            As I mentioned, what about those systems that had been sanitized
            together between Frontend & Backend it's a common thing they know
            but it doesn't mean they actually solve the whole malicious problem.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So if I already do my best to sanitize, do some security test and
            many testings just to solve the malicious-free software the problem
            is still there. So does that mean we need to rely to make our own
            software to belong under open-source?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            To be more specific, It's better if they wanted to make that kind of
            choice so that the curiousity could not actually take some place in
            different way. In digital society, we really need more impacts to
            protect our own identities including our own privacies although it
            is not capable tt we areha still believing for.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            That's why the idea of Open Source could really help us to diverse
            this kind of unfateful bridge of humanity towards the digital
            society.
