            Let's confuse the future developers nowadays at the very beginning
            of their phase on asking what's the typically way to learn coding.
            There are so many articles and videos that you might actually see
            talking for this but let me take you take there in such a weird
            experience.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            During my time as a begineer who only knows to work with UI
            Designing I was about to pay for Bootcamp to learn Frontend
            Development here in the Philippines but it didn't happened due to my
            overloaded schedule to think upon UI projects.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So the time opportunity for me to attend bootcamps has gone because
            of pandemic then I decided also to find some time to learn thru
            self-taught.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            In self-taught learning there is usually depends on the choice that
            you really wanted either you want to lose your social
            interactivities or seek help from those people that assures to you
            or seek help from those strangers that you might seen online.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            There's widening pros & cons of being a self-taught learner in most
            of time let's emphasize this
          </figcaption>
          <div class="copied-text">
            <figcaption>
              Self-education is suited to people who are independent,
              self-disciplined, and practice good time management. Formal
              education is for those who need structure, routine, constant
              guidance, immediate feedback, and enjoy being part of a classroom
              environment.
            </figcaption>

              - from Autodidact entitled Autodidact vs. Formal Education: Which
              Is Better?
            </span>
          </div>
          <figcaption>
            Autodidact is the act of self-directed learning. If you feel better
            for it then why not to proceed? there's an iconic line which tells
            that if you want to be good don't socialise, don't expect it and
            don't ask whyðŸŽµ

          <figcaption>
            After I graduated in senior high school saddenly here in my country
            (Philippines) the disbeliefs in part that you can't get into highly
            stable jobs around the high school level despite they also tell that
            finding a job is easy like what a lie right.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            You can find a job very easily even if I didn't proceed to college
            now but the salary here is very bare minimum which even you and us
            could not afford it. Certainly, I had some article here where I also
            tell that I've no longer wanted to see many of filpino IT students,
            IT professionals and IT alumnis because I don't want them for some
            reason. (they can probably understand it because it's my choice
            right?)
          </figcaption>
          <div class="copied-text">
            <figcaption>
              In today's online climate, self education is easier than ever.
              It's a great choice for those who have complicated schedules or
              social anxieties. College is still the king, though, when it comes
              to reputable degrees. If the name behind your qualification is
              important to you, choose college.
            </figcaption>
            <span>
              - from Autodidact entitled Self Education vs. College: Which Is
              Right for You?

          <figcaption>
            If the software engineering or web development job mostly can be
            done by self-taught then why would I need to take the related degree
            for it? The response is very simple it's purely about your name.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Most of successful and very known programmers in different field of
            IT industry today is they we're prefferably self-taught learners and
            this is true.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            You can simple enjoy around exploring Data Structures and
            Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming or Dynamic Programming and
            solve many coding problems around LeetCode that's the best way to learn
            than taking a IT degree seriously it becomes more meaningful rather
            than asking what have you learn in your school.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So, after exploring the simple understanding in the world of being a
            self-taught what's the purpose of coding bootcamps anyway?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            The main purpose of attending coding bootcamps is that you're
            actively gonna do a social interactivities between your classmate
            and your instructor. Personally, I prefer you to do this rather than
            paying attention to become self-taught learner
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Why? I don't want you to be like me in fact so that you're not gonna
            take it hard so much to ask for your coding problem. In my time it's
            hard to seek some help in fact, I didn't achieve that even in the
            most important times which I ended up that there's no someone who
            can help me out.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I encourage you to make some group of friends that suits to your
            ethically needs and do some time to learn coding together that thing
            is still the best rather than paying attention to self-taught
            learner in most of time that's my argument.
