            What on earth am I thinking at? Idk exactly but after three years of
            having an experience to work with Figma seriously I get more
            interest to make many UIs than the actual coding the problem is that
            this could be my game changing? I think no, I began to learn coding
            in about 5 years so probably I will be fine if I don't wanted to
            take some interest to become a future senior developer but those are
            just company rules like do I need to think about this even it was
            stupid?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            The idea to me is that you have a power but it's limitless meaning
            it only applies for specific thing (like company) so it doesn't
            count for the whole unless if you wanted to join capitalist +
            monopoly party if you wanted bitch I will fight you ðŸ¤£
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Just kidding but it's essential to know where you feel and
            comfortable at most rather than telling before it's too late so I
            think getting my IT degree is my mistake for hiding my true passion
            and also talent but my curiousity towards digital society gives me
            to continue these even though I really have no interest to interact
            with future IT students, IT alumni and also filipino IT
            professionals like I don't give a shit to them also like I'm gonna
            hate them for some reason with no chance to see them clearly.

          <figcaption>
            So I hope I can have some time to discuss why do I hate some of
            filipino devs for some reason so you can either wait for my new shit
            article here probably after a months so it takes very long hehe

            Now, I mentioned for a mysterious fact that I get more productive by
            doing UI design rather than doing some front-end coding and then
            what's getting worse? is that i'm afraid for telling I have my skill
            issue.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Yes at all because I live in many sorrows of being a self-taught in
            most of time I have my one best man who I used to seek many things
            to help me before so I really love him so much but I ended up to
            delete my discord account now (he has alias named xuronno idk if he
            change) so I have no connected conversations to him anymore since I
            don't use facebook + messenger & discord anymore for hiding my
            digital presence only.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            My best decision could be depend on the situation where I feel
            better I think? if there's a chance to ended my 20 years span to
            just spend designing for them I think I will be fine if I never met
            to senior developer level idk I'm fine for this.
