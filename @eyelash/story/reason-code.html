            Finally, I've released this article today to tell my own personal
            space so congrats to me ðŸ¥°. Now, the date today is August 27 so
            after 5 years of exploring digital world now I have my ability to
            tell my stories so here it is.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Wayback, 2018 my character couldn't understand that time cause I
            live in somewhat like childish and can't comprehend for having an
            empathy to his classmates at all.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            That time it was the moment when I gain an issue where I can't play
            the game (League of Legends) until it makes me mad because I can't
            access my garena there until I realized that the computer I use is
            frequently vulnerable I discovered there was shit application that
            records keyboard input or so-called KeyLogger.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            That time my Garena (such a dead platform 4 now I think?) doesn't
            have specific recovery option if I got some password problems so
            once if I do anything wrong then there's no way I can recover so it
            became to be true. Someone change the identity of my Garena account
            until he make me mad HAHAHA.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            On the following day, I do something like (hack that nigga) but not
            in keylogger way I do some bruteforcing to knowing their common
            password they generally used so it takes more than hours to expose
            the password until I get it afterall I do the same thing hehe
            meanwhile, their reaction which I suffer before it looks so similar
            but for them it makes them so bad like I'm gonna laugh because that
            time they are seriously questioned by the original owner which he
            used to play Garena (LoL) he can't blame me because he didn't know
            me either ðŸ˜‚
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I only have a phone in that time, that's the only way I can
            communicate with fucking strangers still shy to interact with my
            family that unders my bloodline so during my high school days I
            spend my whole time to resonate my remaining teenage days before I
            get into adultery life (I was telling my life before 18).
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            During my high school life I really wanted to make someday a
            wonderful website that suits to my ethical needs I really dought
            very much that bugs is part of an eternity to exist that's the
            reason why I used to be an blackhat believer before. I always think
            for doing bad things like I want more money money money just like
            how I wanted to learn carding tricks I think this is reason why I
            became misogynist for some reason? I lose my confidence to
            understand every women due to my tragic past (still problem for now
            sorry).
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            As a result to what I used to be I ended up to explore programming
            in 2019. I begin my exploritation to learn basic things like HTML
            and CSS whereas I have no idea about the reality of programming
            which might be a perfect regret where I should begin first to
            proceed in high-level languages like Python or Java whatever.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            My first lines of code is actually written in Python so basically I
            do some for loop string declaration that time in my favorite
            computer shop so yeah I'm not lying you hear it overthere I was
            actually a native computer shop enjoyer very well.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I like it because I actually do some copy paste things until it
            works like what the hell it's cute aside from for loop string
            declaration I also do some print that string forever until the
            machine goes down ðŸ¤£
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So, uh let me share to you my experience that I achieve upon doing
            crazy things as a hobbyist tech guy.
