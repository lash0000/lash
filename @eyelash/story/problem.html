            Ok, let's talk about our skills in terms of socializing someone
            believes that having a social skills could help you to develop your
            knowledge to engage skills, energizing, having some motivation and
            so much more to consider.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Many around us are totally believing that having a social
            interaction in most of time could benefit in some way to get you out
            of touch and also to know you + to know them as well.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Socialising to me is unfaithful kind where I also believe that the more
            that I spend some time to social interact is that they also had some
            idea to know me more or even less in terms of personality (this it totally stupid).
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            If I think for many reason is that this "socialising" term is not
            totally a issue at all because if I was a introvert in the first
            place I will get more serious in everything now, people claim to me
            that I had this kind of ability but the truth is that I haven't you
            know.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            I had no ability to care about the academic performance because in
            my whole life as a student I frequently do more to pay attention to
            my skills rather than thinking for my failing academic grades so why
            would I wanted to think for it right?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Anyone of us had also the right if they wanted to become such a
            inspiration or even if they wanted to use them for any kind of
            purposes but to me is that I frequently might not need to look
            around them because I had nothing to offer and also, I tend to
            prefer to look around myself on how can I deal with my own personal
            problems.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            In my personal experience as a student there's no way that I also
            encountered different kinds of horrific things that comes from my
            batchmates and now also my colleagues which reflects in following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Being a bullied during high-school days I can't understand
                myself where in most of time I use to have no empathy at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Socially afraid so it was the result of my high-school days
                where I almost get lost and become delusional until now it is
                became my whole personality problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                Being misogynist because I think every women is totally a
                disaster like why would I wanted to find more guts? to lose my
                virginity?
              </li>
              <li>
                Even in online platform you can't find my prescence there for
                example Messenger my account is very secretly behind after 5
                years of doing so until now they can't find some way to ask me
                either because I restrict the message delivery request feature
                (this from Messenger platform).
              </li>
              <li>
                So in order to hide my prescence digitally I actually preffer to
                look for the platforms that's not really popular and such a good
                underrated level like that's not related about like Discord,
                Instagram, Threads, TikTok and etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So in my case, there's someone who's interrogative to ask the same
            thing like am I a totally a Introvert? or Extrovert? so in my
            response I haven't made anything yet until he tells.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            He tells me that I had no ability in the Introvert level he
            emphasized that I haven't no frequently signs in order to describe
            it which I agree in somehow also he pointed out that in terms of
            socially engagement I also had some ability but it not from the
            level that he wants.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            Because when he after asked like what do you think to the people? I
            respond to him like I don't want them anymore then he laughs. So he
            asked me the same thing but it comes from women so why don't you
            trust them to make some friendships even if it's for school thing?
            so I answered the same response like why would I wanted to friends
            with them? to defame my personality? and make it as a laughingstock?
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So when you look at my response that time it was actually an insult
            because I actually realize that the way I respond is that I'm more
            superior than someone who's socially actived and also I had more
            weird personality that it's frequently hard to tell + I had the
            duality response which totally it may caught the attention to the
            reader like he can't understand.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So if ever you gonna ask me the same thing like what's your
            personality in fact is that I'm more likely to mention that I don't
            give a shit don't tell me it to me we are not in the same boat as
            far as I can tell.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            So I strongly believe that having some social interactions is like a
            bubble when it pops out then it will be strongly fade away as the
            way we look around ourselves that we may had done in the past.
          </figcaption>
          <figcaption>
            The planet is becoming more challenging as the way we wanted to
            change in fact, there's more anything to care about is that what
            could be our exchange while we live in such a short lifespan just
            like that kind of thinking for our own good as well.
