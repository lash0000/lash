This page is typically a portfolio + my blog page.

The reason that I wanted to make this as standard file-based HTML pages instead
of working with dynamical operations like using web-framework in order to settle
these things not very much to be hard-headed to me.

Personally, I want to justify some disbeliefs that I used to it up to now
it would never be the same by mistakes that I frequently learned.

This page is surely prone to any kinds of web attacks since parsing my XML data to client
is the biggest reason that's why I make the software release under GPL v3 (Free Software Foundation).

Now, if you wanted to run their LibreJS that's a firefox extension this webpage may not
work simply because some of my javascript rules is following the unobtrusive method.

I believe we can take some time to read their blog article named The JavaScript Trap

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html

There are so many things to argue that every websites had javascript but we can't
truly find some page that doesn't uses any kinds of JavaScript yet unless the webpage
only relies HTML + CSS very simple.

I have so many reason why did I stop using TypeScript / JavaScript language for 
big projects due to many reasons that I don't want to consider. Theoretically, 
it's based on my experience as well.

LibreJS is purely disagree in WebAssembly for the humility to protect our
identity while surfing in our favorite browser (Firefox-based).
