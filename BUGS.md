This page is typically a portfolio + my blog page.

The reason that I wanted to make this as standard file-based HTML pages instead
of working with dynamical operations like using web-framework in order to settle
these things not very much to be hard-headed to me is that I want to save my life
to explore wayback to the things that surely the Internet deserves I know this is
awkward but I can't help to figure what it means.

Personally, I want to justify some disbeliefs that I used to it much before I know
it would never be the same by my mistakes that I also learned.

This page is surely prone to any kinds of web attacks since by parsing my XML data into client page
is the biggest reason why I make the software release under GPL v3 (Free Software Foundation).

Now, if you wanted to run their LibreJS that's a firefox extension this webpage may not
work simply because some of my javascript rules is following the unobtrusive method.

I believe we can take some time to read their blog article named The JavaScript Trap

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html

There are so many things to argue that every websites had javascript but we can't
truly find some page that doesn't uses any kinds of JavaScript yet unless the webpage
only relies HTML + CSS very simple.

I have so many reason why did I stop using TypeScript / JavaScript language for 
big projects due to many reasons that I don't want to consider. Theoretically, 
it's based on my experience as well.

So as my decision I formally abandoned one of my supposedly a biggest project written
in that kind of programming language mentioned this is my Rigma (such a news portal btw) 
I had some biggest mistake that I ever experience is that I didn't met the simple DRY 
principle however, if you look at the whole program is totally mess in other words you 
can say that you really don't like it as the way that we really need to 
follow some of the rules as a developer.

By the way, let's get back to topic so LibreJS is purely disagree with WebAssembly 
for the sake of their philosophy to prohibit to run JavaScript in their machine
not a big deal to be exact but it's up to you which may ever you like as I said
my page is purely prone to any kinds of web attacks I can't take it.
